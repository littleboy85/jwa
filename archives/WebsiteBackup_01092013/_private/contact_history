The site is clear and easy to use, and even on dial-up did not take long to load.
We&#39;re looking forward to seeing more of your work appear in your Gallery.  You do such captivating paintings.
We wish you well on the launch of your new website.  Hope the increased exposure does wonders for your career!

My only concern about having a site----does this now mean you are writing off expenses and paying income tax?  Not sure if this is an issue where the gov&#39;t checks up on us &quot;starving artists&quot;.

My friend Kim met you at the Fringe and gave me your website.  She said you might be interested in doing consignment.  I love your work and would be very interested in putting some in my shop in Didsbury Ab.
I charge 30% on consignment.  Would you be interested?  If you could give me a better price on cards I would be interested in buying some wholesale.
Look forward to hearing from you.

I don&#39;t know if that was you today at Folk Fest selling your paintings. Either way, I really enjoy your paintings. The color, content and dreamlike quality are exactly the characteristics that I appreciate in art. Anyway, your website says you still have the original for Magical Reflections available. How much are you selling it for?

I saw your paintings first on TV then at Folk Fest and just love them (I am the SLP who said hello).  Could you let me know the next time you are having an exhibit somewhere? I the meantime I will start saving up because I&#39;d love a big canvas piece.

  I spoke with you on Saturday evening at Folk Fest. I am very interested in your art and would like to pick up a few pieces for Christmas gifts. I believe the pieces I wanted were $17.00 Dancing with the Moon. How do I go about picking these up from you and possibly purchasing a few more? I live in Saskatoon as well.

Hope you remember me.  I am Brenda who worked with you at Fishermen&#39;s Net.  I would like to order one of your prints.  I was wondering if you would be able to sign it.  Also, rather than sending the print through the mail, I would love to have a quick visit with you and catch up a bit.  I could pick up the picture and pay you directly this way as well if that is all right.  I am still deciding which print (tough - i like them all) but I will try to make up my mind in the next day or so.

Hope to see you soon.

You said you didn&#39;t have a name for it yet but that you&#39;d had alot of interest expressed about it.  At that point you did not yet have reprints but thought you might later in the summer.  I am very interest in purchasing a 10x16 Giclée Print on Paper of this paitning.  Do you have any available?

We met at the Fringe Festival and I&#39;m on your mailing list.  I was sad to not be able to attend your recent show, but thought of you immediately when I was asked to coordinate artwork for an upcoming event related to the wisdom of Mother Earth.  I thought of you because when I see your creations, it connects me to the simple joy of being, to living in harmony with ourselves and our environment, the human family and our purpose on this planet.

Stalmar Productions is brining internationally renowned Pepper Lewis to town - she is a  channel for Gaia, or Mother Earth.  I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re familiar with her or this type of thing so I&#39;ve posted below some links and an invitation to an introductory evening this Wednesday.  Pepper would like to have a few artists showcased in the space during her 2.5 day workshop - not only to decorate the space but to also to promote their work and have an opportunity to sell it.

I may have some of my nature&#39;s photographs there as well.  I would love to feature your paintings around the room to add that joyful connection between the planet and humanity .  Does this interest you?

The event is April 11-13th at the Saskatoon Inn, in the small conference room behind the elevators opposite the hotel registration desk.  Doug Martin of Stalmar is expecting about 100 people although it&#39;s always hard to tell until the day of.  We&#39;re three weeks away and they&#39;ve got 25 people registered so far.  But many will come for the intro night even if they don&#39;t attend the full workshop.  

You wouldn&#39;t need to be onsite - but to set up the way you&#39;d like your artwork displayed.  I&#39;m awaiting a few more details from Doug about the logistics but wanted to get in touch with you as soon as possible.

Please call me at 244-0241 or email me at dominique@courtneymilne.com to let me know how you feel about this offer.  Doug will be at the DVD intro night on Wednesday (see below) if you&#39;d like to get a better feel for Pepper Lewis and her work before committing.  The website links will also provide a lot of information.  I hope you&#39;ll see this as the win-win opportunity I do.  You&#39;re the only artist I am approaching at this time so I look forward to your reply.

I was talking to you at the fringe about a Canadian website for artists started by a Saskatoon man by the name of Paul Constable . . .  I gave you the wrong site co-ordinates.  Here is the correct address

I was in your tent on Saturday Monday afternoon at the Fringe in Saskatoon. I was with my husband and we were interested in one of your newest paintings that were on display. Or actually, we&#39;re interested in a print of it. Maybe 20x32 Giclée Print on Paper - $85.00... The painting didn&#39;t have a name but was vertical, bright green strings and were located on the opposite tent wall from were you were sitting. Do you know which one? You said a print would probably be done in September. Can you check into when it can be printed and if the above size is good for that painting and how much the total price would be to ship it to Calgary? 
Thank you so much, 
Lisa Wigerblad
(and husband Dave Krebs)

Just taking a look at your gallery and 3 of your pieces jumped out at me
1.  I&#39;m On My Way
2.  Tranquility
3.  Height of Eccentricity

So I or actually Merl would like to commission an orignal somewhere along those lines...  You can pick the colors but add some texture etc...  I don&#39;t recall your pricing but something for $500...

Take your time as there is no need to rush as we can alway get it shipped out here.

Take care and congratualtions on your upcoming wedding!!

This is Alison from Monday night weight class.  Lonnie (husband) and I went to Jake&#39;s today so I could show him your work.  We would like to know how much you are asking for the picture of the lady in the green dress with the gold balls and red background.  Sorry, there were no names for the pictures.  Do you have some place where all of your available works are on display?

See ya Monday perhaps,

Okay I am terrible at narrowing down!  I had it down to 4, then down to 3 and I could go no further! 

So! Could I please get one 12x18 print of each of the following:
- I&#39;m On My Way
- Elation
- Sand Dunes and Purple Moons

I&#39;ll pop over to the art show after work on Friday. I have a hair appt at 5:30 on Broadway so I won&#39;t be able to stay as long as I&#39;d like but at least I&#39;ll have a quick look!

My name is Natalya Mason. I&#39;m involved with the Saskatoon Caribbean Association and i&#39;ve seen your work at Folkfest. My mom also has a piece at our house. I recently started working at a coffee shop on 2nd avenue. We just opened up in the front of the def SOL dance studios. We were discussing having some local art displayed and your paintings came to mind because they&#39;re bright and beautiful and feature dancers. We would be interested in having a couple pieces for display, that would be available for sale. 

If you&#39;re interested you can contact me 
Natalya 280-4529 or 373-3396

or you can contact Anita at the coffee shop

I&#39;m in the process of ordering prints for my 3 daughters for Christmas. Your work is wonderful and as enticing as all your paintings are, I think I have my choices narrowed down to &quot;Sand Dunes and Purple Moons,&quot; &quot;Simple Abundance&quot; and the one on your home page with the girl in the trapeze, if it&#39;s available. Do you have any special recommendations?
I believe we might have met once when you were teaching at the Cote or Keeseekoose reserve. You are an accomplished woman.
I look forward to hearing from you.

I bought a painting from you this summer at the fringe.  The painting was the one with just one girl in a pink dress and yellow and green back ground.  Anyways,you had sad that you would be painting the girl with the purple dress this fall.  I would like to see that one.  If you have finished that one and it is available for me to look at, please contact me by email.

If I don&#39;t I would like to make this purchase through your website. 

Would you be able to suggest what I could purchase that would be along the &quot;dancer&quot; theme.  I am not clear on the difference between cardstock and Giclee paper.  I would like to purchase something ready to display if possible. Some of my favorites are &quot;Elation&quot;, Daytime Baleerina&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m on my Way&quot;  Thank you for any suggestions and guidance you can provide.  

Your work is beautiful and charming!

I just wanted to let you know that I have purchased your &quot;Yukon Buds&quot; from Willow Studio.  I was at the opening and it caught my eye immediately.  I had been looking for a larger piece for a specific spot in my house.  In the days that followed, I kept thinking about your work and I had to go back and bring it home with me!  I have found a great spot for it and we are really enjoying it.  There is a lovely shimmer to it which changes in tones depending on the lighting and time of day.  Just thought you&#39;d like to know that it has found an appreciative new home!  Thank you!

Our son, Kaelan, just showed me a piece of art he did from your teaching.  It is absolutely beautiful.  We then googled your name and pulled up more of your paintings.  BREATH TAKING!!!! I would really like to purchase one, or some cards or something one day.  I will send more info later.  Also, I know this is on really short notice, but our son has autism and our daughter has and intelecual disability with autistic tendencies.  On May 8 is the Autism Gala.  It is a huge and formal fundraiser to raise money for Autism.  Would you be interested in donating something for bidding?  I could get you the formal papers to do this for authenticity.  Keep up the incredible work.

I heard of you through Paul Runalls - I teach his daughters Highland Dancing and we are both on a committee hosting the Canadian Championships of Highland Dancing here in Saskatoon this July. Paul says his friend Carla Evans has maybe spoken to you...  To cut to the point, I am hosting a reception during the 4-day &#39;Series at which there will be an art show/sale exhibiting local emerging artists. This is just to add a fun and &quot;Sask&quot; flair to this annual event. The crowd is small (60-80) but consists of dance teachers and judges from all over the world. I think your work would be a hit, especially the dance/movement related ones. Would you be interested in submitting one of your pieces? (something that could be carried home on a plane would be best!) Please let me know what more information you would like. I hope to hear back from you!

I stopped by your booth at the Broadway street fair and loved your paintings.  I also just recently saw the two that you have at the Persephone Theatre.  I am interested to purchase one or perhaps two of your paintings for my daughter who just loves to dance.  I won&#39;t have sufficient funds saved by Christmas but am hoping by her birthday in May I will have enough put aside.  I was wondering if you would have photos or could please send a list of the paintings (if any are on your website) that you have as originals with their prices?  I quite liked the &quot;serendipity&quot; from Persephone.  Whenever you have a chance to reply back would be great.  Will you be at any more shows throughout the year?

I have long admired your art.  You have a wonderful way with color and your figures seem to be filled with joy, light and life.  
I have just been give a gift of money from the congregation I served for 9 years as minister with children.  The congregation asked me to use the money to purchase a piece of art that would help me remember my years with them.  I am thought of you and your wonderful art right away and I am wondering if you might be having a show sometime soon.  I have glanced your Gallery and I am having a hard time figuring out what you might have in stock as original art and how much those pieces might be.  
I look forward to hearing from you.

I was totally planning on coming to your NIGHT ON THE TOWN EVENT! The card has been in my car staring at me for months (since summer).  Sommething came up unexpectedly, so I was unable to make it all weekend....Hope it was a success!  I was wanting to ask if your (was it mother-in-law or sister-in law??), bought that painting....Was it Presenting??  I saw introducing....on the website but wasn&#39;t sure if there was a presenting.... Anyways, I do want an original at some point!  We are just about to get Anna&#39;s room re-done, so when I looked at the website, I also loved a few of the others (love them all really).  Is it &quot;Sing Dance Play&quot; and another 2 I was interested in....Was wondering about the special orders as I am sure the originals are gone!  Like a print on Canvas.  Let me know, or call me!  373-2662.  I know you are getting ready for the Sundog, so probably busy, so take your time getting back to me if need be!

Canvas prints of:  Uptown Girls, Calypso Berry Extravaganza and Perennial Moon Dancing.  I would like the prints to be as large as possible that Gord Sanjenko can print. I would like to have them framed as you had them at your art show.  I can have this done myself or you could give me price quotes framed and unframed.

I realize that you will be at the Sundog Fair this weekend and are probably busy getting ready for that.  If you want to wait until next week for the quotes, that is fine.

Sorry I keep missing you.  I am heading downtown this morning at about 11:00 for an appointment and I could drop off the painting somewhere if that works for you.  Otherwise, I will be home from 1:30 till 3:00 and after 4:30 today if you wanted to have it picked up.  My address is 659 Frobisher Terrace in Lawson Heights.

Bill S</p><hr><p><b>email: </b>lganes@unitedwaysaskatoon.ca<br><b>Date: </b>Monday December 17, 2012<br><b>Time: </b>09:33 AM -0600<br></p><h3>Comment</h3><p>Good morning Janet, 

United Way of Saskatoon and Area holds an Achievement Awards celebration at the end of January each year. The event celebrates money raised during our annual campaign, the positive change that money will create in our community, and the efforts of many organizations that have supported the campaign. Often, we have what we call &#39;Million Dollar Awards&#39; to present to organizations who have reached Million dollar milestones. For these awards, we often look for a piece of local artwork to frame and present. 

Your piece, Delight in the Simple Pleasures, has caught our eye. I am wondering if there are large prints available for purchase? If yes, can you please send me the details (pricing, size, etc)? 

Thank you Janet. I look forward to hearing from you soon. 

Happy Holidays!
